This is a simple alarm clock that goes off from a browser tab

In order to setup an alarm please do the following:  

```git clone https://github.com/astaniano/alarm_clock.git```

open an empty tab in a browser and paste <path_to_the_folder_where_you_cloned_your_repo>/index.html
Or open the folder where this code was downloaded to and drag and drop index.html file into the browser url.
Then setup the expected time for an alarm to go off and leave that tab open.
Meanwhile you can work in other tabs
